            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now about ſixe yeares ſince I was moſt unfortunately taken by a Turkes man of Warre, on the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary</hi> captive into <hi>Argiere;</hi> ſince which time I have written oft to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to Maſter <hi>Southwood</hi> of the upperground, to <hi>Richard Barnard</hi> of Dukes place, <hi>Richard Coole</hi> of the Bank-ſide, to Maſter <hi>Linger</hi> an Haberdaſher in crooked Lane, and in that to Maſter <hi>Southwood</hi> I ſent an incloſed to my Father, ifliving, and other Letters to my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and friends, if not dead; I could never heare whether any of you were alive or dead, which makes me thinke the Letters are either miſcarried, or all of you deceaſed, or gone to other places, or elſe I know you are ſo much Chriſtians and friends, that you would have looked upon me in ſuch a condition. O my friends, once more I tell you, I am a miſerable Captive in <hi>Argiere,</hi> taken by a Flemiſh Veſſell, two yeares after I left the Warres in <hi>Gilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> my Patroone is one <hi>Baron</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Renegado that lives in the Country, but hires me and another Proteſtant Captive (one Maſter <hi>Robinſon</hi> a <hi>Norfolke</hi> man) out into <hi>Argiere</hi> for this time, and if we goe up to the Country you may never heare of us againe; our miſery is, that the price of our redemption will be no leſſe then 250. 1. becauſe we are thought to have good friends in <hi>England,</hi> and we muſt both goe off together. Maſter <hi>Robinſon</hi> hath written to his friends, and we have deeply bound our ſelves to each other, that we will ingage our friends to us both equally; Ah, Father, Brother, friends and acquaintance, uſe ſome ſpeedy meanes for our Redemption, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Slaves have been redeemed from their miſery ſince we came hither, which makes us hope ſtill we may be the next, and then the next, but ſtill our hopes are deceived. We doe pray you therefore for the Lords Chriſts ſake that redeemed you, that you would uſe all poſſible meanes for our redemption. There is now a part in <hi>England</hi> renowned over the Chriſtian world for their Piety this way, O make your addreſſe to thoſe noble worthies in the name of Chriſt, for whoſe ſake we ſuffer; we did never ſo well underſtand the meaning of that Pſalme, penned by thoſe captive <hi>Jewes</hi> held in Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh captivity as now, <hi>By the waters of Babilon we ſate down and wept, vvhen vve remembred thee, O Sion,</hi> when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred thee, O <hi>England.</hi> O good friends, we hope theſe our ſighs will come to your eares, and move pitty and compaſſion. We are told there is a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Stanner</hi> of St. Mary-Axe, that hath a Factor in <hi>Legorne,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mico, Londoners,</hi> that are dealers there, who are able to direct you in the readieſt way for our redemption; deny us not your prayers if you can doe nothing elſe, it will be ſome comfort to heare from friends. There is a Poſt in <hi>London</hi> that conveyes Letters into all parts, and you may have an opportunity of letting us heare from you, if you pleaſe within a month or ſix weeks. The Lord direct your thoughts with waies of love, and ſtrengthen us with faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
